Sanju," directed by Rajkumar Hirani,
 is a biographical film that delves into 
the tumultuous life of Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt. 
The reel version, starring Ranbir Kapoor as Sanjay Dutt,
 dramatizes the actor's battles with drug addiction, legal issues,
 and his relationship with his father, Sunil Dutt. While the film captures 
the essence of Sanjay's struggles, it does take creative liberties. For instance, 
certain characters are composites or fictionalized versions of real people, and timelines a
re sometimes altered for dramatic effect. In reality, Sanjay Dutt's life has been a series of 
ups and downs, with periods of intense media scrutiny, which the film portrays to an extent, but 
the nuances of his personal relationships and the full scope of his legal troubles are somewhat sanitized 
or simplified for cinematic appeal.
Raazi: Real vs. Reel
"Raazi," directed by Meghna Gulzar, is based on the true story of an Indian spy, Sehmat Khan, 
who married a Pakistani military officer during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 to gather intelligence. The reel 
version stars Alia Bhatt as Sehmat and presents a gripping narrative of her espionage activities. The film is based on Harinder
 S. Sikka's novel "Calling Sehmat," which fictionalizes and dramatizes real events. In the movie, Sehmat is shown as a courageous and
 skilled spy who faces numerous challenges and moral dilemmas. While the core of Sehmat's story is true, certain aspects are embellishe
d or altered for dramatic purposes. The real-life Sehmat's identity remains undisclosed, and her story is likely more complex 
and nuanced than depicted, with the film focusing on major events to keep the narrative engaging and emotionally impactful.
